**Title:** SymMedic

**Description** 

This application is based on a crowd-sourced model. The application captures users symptoms through a user-friendly questionnaire on a website and provides information about the most probable diseases they might be suffering from. The application would also provide a recommendation of doctors that are best suited to treat the disease based on user's location. The application will take the generated data from users to create a trend analysis of diseases.

**Problem**

- People are frustrated with lack of accessing family doctor at the time of need
- Long wait times (sometimes months) of the non urgent cases
- Most of the people admit to self diagnosing themselves through Google
- New parents take the help of social media to avoid unnecessary doctor visits

**Design Objective**

- Create a solution to reduce the hassle of unnecessary visits to doctors and hospital
